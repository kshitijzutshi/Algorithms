## Bubble Sort

In this algorithm, we work towards making array into a partition of sorted and unsorted. The unsorted index starts from the end of the array and after each pass of the Bubble sort, it decrements by 1.
By this way the index i dosent have to loop over the sorted element ( largest element that gets sorted in the first pass).

The following image illustrates the same:
