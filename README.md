### Quick find
The First implementation of an algorithm for solving the dynamic connectivity problem, called Quick-find. This is a so called eager algorithm, for solving connectivity problem.

For reference I found the following two links particualrly helpful, as to WHY we need disjoint data structures:

1. HackerEarth Blog Post [**Basics of Disjoint Data Structures**](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/data-structures/disjoint-data-strutures/basics-of-disjoint-data-structures/tutorial/)
2. Question on Quora regarding application of Disjoint data structures Post [**What are the applications of disjoint set data structure?**](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-applications-of-disjoint-set-data-structure)


### Quick Guide to master GitHub Markdown

I found this [**link**](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) particularly helpful. If you want to use Emojis in your markdown, check [**this**](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md) out. :100:
